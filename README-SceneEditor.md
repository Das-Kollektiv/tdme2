- What is TDMESceneEditor?
    - TDME based scene editor 

- What is already working
    - prototype library
        - in general
            - setting up prototype properties
                - key, value map for what ever reason
        - models
            - see model editor
        - particle systems
            - see particle system editor
        - terrain
            - see terrain editor
        - empties
        - trigger
        - environment mappings
    - scene editor
        - setting up a grid where to place prototypes on
        - setting up snapping where to align prototypes at
        - load, save scenes, showing scene dimension
        - import scenes from model files like FBX, DAE or TM
        - setting up scene properties
            - key, value map for what ever reason
        - entities, which are instances from prototypes
             - set up name, description
             - see prototype name, center
        - setting up entity transformations for a single or multiple entities
             - translation
             - scaling
             - rotation
             - color your entities
             - center entities
             - remove entities
             - reflection using a environment mapping
        - entities can be transformed by using a gizmo
        - setting up entity properties
             - key, value map for what ever reason
        - set up up to 8 lights (for now)
        - see and select entities(models, particle systems, empties and trigger) from prototype library to place them in the scene
        - rotate, zoom and pan scene
        - copy and paste
    - other
        - large models like terrain meshes can be partitioned in 64mx64mx64m objects

- What is WIP
    - set up arbitrary lights as entities
    - audio support
