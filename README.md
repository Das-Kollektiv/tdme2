        - can be easily extended by writing state machine machine states and script methods in C++
        - works with the following data types: null, boolean, integer, float, string, vector2, vector3, vector4, quaternion, matrix3x3, matrix4x4, transform, array, map and set
        - when calling script methods/returning from methods it does not use references or pointers but only value by copy
        - supports user script functions and recursion
        - supports kind of references by optionally assigning back argument values to variables
        - supports operators by operator to method mapping by a preprocessor run
        - supports loops and conditions
        - supports programming with classes style programming
          - for string, vector2, vector3, vector4, quaternion, matrix3x3, matrix4x4, transform, array, map and set data types
          - custom data types and custom script classes are planned
        - supports event like programming
        - can be transpiled to C++
        - how to use:
          - each script is attached to a game entity
          - communication between script instances is possible by
            - using callable functions
            - sending signals with arguments
          - complex logic should still be implemented by a game developer in C++ by extending MiniScript
          - game designers can use MiniScript + those methods to implement high level game logic
        - MiniScript methods/states know about them self, so a whole documentation for MiniScript usage can be generated later
- Networking module, which consists of
    - UDP server
        - n:m threading model with non blocked IO via kernel event mechanismns(epoll, kqueue or select)
        - supports safe messages with acknowledgment and automatic resending

        - has single thread with a simple threadsafe API
        - supports all features required by UDP server

        - also has some additional UDP specific network functionality
        - has easy polling like access to underlying path finding threads
        - does logics management and execution in a separate thread
	- application server and client threads also do physics computations
    - logics which do live in application server context and application client context are capable of
        - update engine entities if living in application client and also update UI and such
        - executing app/game logic that change logic state, which can be visualized(see point above) and/or synched by network
        - easy access to manage audio playback
        - handling HID input
