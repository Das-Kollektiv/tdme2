- What does it (maybe still) lack
    - physics
      - some more RP3D integration
    - example games
    - documentation

- What is WIP or planned
    - Improve on Vulkan
    - PBR lighting shader for GL3/CORE+
    - simple script language for GUI
    - Expose shader and post processing programs setup API
    - Some UI elements need some default skinning fixes
    - WaveFront OBJ model file reader is broken currently
    - Integrate a scripting language to be able to script TDME2 applications or sub logics
    - Build documentation
    - Public API documentation
    - A release plan
    - A demonstration video

- Technology
    - designed for simple multi threading, but
        - 3D rendering engine uses 4 threads if using Vulkan renderer, or one thread only if using a GL renderer
        - UDP client has its own thread
        - UDP server can have multiple IO threads, multiple worker threads and always has its own server thread
        - physics or game mechanics can also run in a separate thread(s)
    - uses 3rd party libraries
    	- need to be installed 
            - GLUT
            - OpenGL
            - OpenAL
