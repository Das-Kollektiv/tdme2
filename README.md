    - What is it?
        - ThreeDeeMiniEngine2 is a lightweight 3D engine including tools suited for 3D games development using C++11

    - What is already working
        - 3d engine

          - multiple bounding volumes for a rigid body

        - example games
        - documentation

    - What is WIP
        - rigid body simulator(needs to be updated to newer "ReactPhysics3D 0.5")
        - GUI system port needs to be finished(Memory Management and other minor things)
        - Logic documentation/comments need to be imported from TDME(-JAVA)

    - Technology
        - designed for simple multi threading
            - 3d engine uses one thread for now
            - physics or game mechanics can run in a separate thread(s)
        - uses 
            - GLUT
            - OpenGL
            - OpenAL
            - Vorbis/OGG,
            - JsonBox
            - zlib
            - libpng
            - tinyxml
            - pthreads
            - (collision resolving of) ReactPhysics3D
            - FBXSDK
        - targeted platforms and its current state
            - Windows/MINGW(port completed)
            - Linux(port is WIP)
            - Mac Os X(port completed)
            - Android(port pending)
            - iOS(port pending)
