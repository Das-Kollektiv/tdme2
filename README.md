- MiniScript
    - very small implementation of a scripting language

    - can be easily extended by writing state machine machine states and script methods in C++ as well as custom data types
    - built-in data types: null, boolean, integer, float, string, vector2, vector3, vector4, quaternion, matrix3x3, matrix4x4, transform, array, map and set

    - supports user script functions and recursion
    - supports operators by operator to method mapping by a preprocessor run
    - supports loops and conditions
    - supports programming with classes style programming
      - for built-in datatypes: string, vector2, vector3, vector4, quaternion, matrix3x3, matrix4x4, transform, array, map and set
      - for script classes/objects
      - for custom data types 
    - supports event like programming
    - can be transpiled to C++
    - how to use:
      - each script is attached to a game entity
      - communication between script instances is possible by
        - using callable functions
        - sending signals with arguments
      - complex logic should still be implemented by a game developer in C++ by extending MiniScript
      - game designers can use MiniScript + those methods to implement high level game logic
    - MiniScript methods/states know about them self, so a whole documentation for MiniScript usage can be generated later

        - also has some additional UDP specific network functionality
        - has easy polling like access to underlying path finding threads
        - does logics management and execution in a separate thread
	- application server and client threads also do physics computations
    - logics which do live in application server context and application client context are capable of
        - update engine entities if living in application client and also update UI and such
        - executing app/game logic that change logic state, which can be visualized(see point above) and/or synched by network
        - easy access to manage audio playback
