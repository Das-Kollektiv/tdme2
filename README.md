- What is already working
    - 3d engine
        - model parsing

- What does it (maybe still) lack
    - animation blending
    - physics
      - some more RP3D integration
    - example games
    - documentation

- What is WIP or planned
    - LOD
    - GUI system port needs to be finished(memory management and other minor things)
    - Some UI elements need some default skinning fixes
    - WaveFront OBJ model file reader is broken currently
    - Integrate LUA to be able to write TDME2 applications completely via LUA or game logics
    - Build documentation
    - Public API documentation
    - A release plan
    - A demonstration video

- Technology
    - designed for simple multi threading
        - 3d engine uses one thread for now
