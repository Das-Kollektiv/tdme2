=====

    - What is it?
        - ThreeDeeMiniEngine is a small 3d engine suited for small 3d games written in C++

    - What is already working
        - 3d engine
            - model parsing
                - WaveFront OBJ
                - DAE parsing with skinned meshes and animations
                    - group names/ids must not have whitespace characters
                    - requires baked matrices
                - TDME Model file format
                    - this is a much more efficient model file format for TDME
                    - can be read and written
                - DAE and WaveFront OBJ files require triangulated meshes for now
            - object transformations
                - scaling
                - rotations
                - translation
            - animations
                - supports base animation and animation overlays
                - supports attaching objects to bones of another objects
            - color effects on objects
                - via shader
                - color addition
                - color multiplication
            - lighting via shaders
                - supports phong lighting

            - particle system which
              - is object based
              - or point based

            - rigid body simulator
              - broadphase collision detection
                  - uses oct tree like partitioning from 16mx16mx16m up to 4mx4mx4m

            - borrows some ideas from AngularJS like
                - all nodes are in the GUI node tree and can be made visible or unvisible depending on conditions
            - adds some improvements like
                - support auto keyword with nodes width and height attributes
            - supported primitive nodes from which compounds are built of
                - element

    - What does it (maybe still) lack
        - animation blending
        - physics
          - bounding volume hierarchies
          - multiple bounding volumes for a rigid body
          - rag doll / joints / springs
        - example games
        - documentation

    - What is WIP
        - rigid body simulator(needs to be updated to newer "ReactPhysics3D 0.5")

    - Technology
        - designed for simple multi threading
            - 3d engine uses one thread for now
            - physics or game mechanics can run in a separate thread(s)
        - uses GLUT, OpenGL, OpenAL, Vorbis/OGG, JsonBox, libpng, tinyxml, pthreads
        - targeted platforms and its current state
            - Windows(port pending)
            - Linux(port is WIP)
            - Mac Os X(port completed)
            - Android(port pending)
            - iOS(port pending)
