    - TDME2 is open source
      - please check the [license](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2/blob/master/LICENSE)
      - you find the source code at [https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2](https://github.com/andreasdr/tdme2) 
      - you find binary alpha builds at [http://drewke.net/tdme2](http://drewke.net/tdme2)
      - you find developer documentation including collaboration graphs and private API as well as public API for current alpha build at [http://drewke.net/tdme2-documentation/alpha](http://drewke.net/tdme2-documentation/alpha)
        - RapidJSON is included, but not yet integrated into documentation, please see [http://rapidjson.org/](http://rapidjson.org/)

- What is already working
    - application
        - creates main window and initializes OpenGL/Vulkan context and does HID via GLUT or GLFW3
        - supports
          - setting window position and dimension
          - setting full screen or windowed, borderless windowed mode
          - setting application icon
          - setting mouse position and mouse cursor
          - executing other applications or background applications
          - swapping double buffered buffers (to screen) manually if required
          - checking if application is active (port-mingw, port-msc only for now)
        - provides
          - a crash handler for port-msc and port-mingw which also saves backtrace to crash.log
          - application life cycle
    - math
        - Math class with common math functions
        - Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix3x3, Matrix4x4 and Quaternion class

    - 3d engine
        - model reader
            - DAE
                - group names/ids must not have whitespace characters

- What does it (maybe still) lack
    - physics
      - some more RP3D integration
    - example games
    - documentation

        - UDP server can have multiple IO threads, multiple worker threads and always has its own server thread
        - HTTP download client has its own thread
        - physics or game mechanics can also run in a separate thread(s)
