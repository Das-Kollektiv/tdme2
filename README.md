        - model parsing
            - DAE parsing with skinned meshes and animations
                - group names/ids must not have whitespace characters

- Technology
    - designed for simple multi threading, but
        - 3D rendering engine uses multiple threads if using Vulkan renderer, or one thread only if using a GL renderer
        - UDP client has its own thread
        - UDP server can have multiple IO threads, multiple worker threads and always has its own server thread
        - HTTP download client has its own thread
        - physics or game mechanics can also run in a separate thread(s)
    - uses 3rd party libraries
