# 4. What does it (maybe still) lack
- physics
  - some more RP3D integration
- example games
- documentation

# 5. What is WIP or planned
- Deferred shading for specular lighting and later also for PBR lighting
- Shader parameters, the system is implemented and working, now lets connect tools and shaders
- Reflections via environment mapping(reflection intensity maps feature is missing for specular materials)
- Optimizing models with specular lighting regarding render calls by reducing nodes and materials to a minumum
- GUI effects via XML definitions
- Port WarStorys "Game Foundation" to TDME2, which organizes game logics, enables communcation between them and enables to do network IO and such
- MiniScript: more engine bindings
- MiniScript: MiniScript -> C++ transpiler
- PBR lighting shader for GL3/CORE+, Vulkan
- Add nmake support to makefile generator for TDME2 based projects
- Improve on Vulkan
- Editor: complete Undo/Redo and Copy/Cut/Paste/Delete
- Editor: Code editing with code completion, also visual editing is planned!
- Expose shader and post processing programs setup API
- Some UI elements need some default skinning fixes
