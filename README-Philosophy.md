# 1. TDME2 philosophy in a nutshell
- Keep it light
- Keep it KISS whenever possible
    - Also keep the C++ style easy and light while having the performance benefits of C++
- Keep it highly maintainable
- Keep the app/game developers role model, e.g:
    - An artist should not need to program, but needs very good tools to get content in a appropriate way into the app/game
    - A UI designer should be able to create UIs without needing to code
    - A game designer should be able to script game content without needing to have a full C++ education
    - A programmer should program mostly
- Keep it portable, so the engine should also be able to run on a toaster :smile: (sorry, I used to love NetBSD)
- Make it complete! It should be possible to create a number of app types or game types with it without really or only adjusting the engine very little
- Be Open Source friendly! We understand that economy currently works only if making money easy said, but still think there should be low cost or open source eco systems for creating 3D apps/games! We also love the power of open source e.g. in terms of sharing knowledge as without the world wide web the engine would not have been possible so far

# 2. What is our idea of "Who is this 3D engine for"?
- Small developer studios that want/insist on having/need a complete, lightweight and free open source 3d engine that they can build upon, improve and such and adapt for their needs
- Anyone who wants to do 3D apps/games prototyping
- Educational purpose: If you want to see how things can be done in a 3D Engine world, feel free to have a look at our little engine :)
