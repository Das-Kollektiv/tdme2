        TRADEMARK:

        The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
        as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
        been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
        the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
        jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

        OSI CERTIFICATION:

        Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
        a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
        the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

        EXPORT CONTROL:

        The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
        Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
        controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
        it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
        any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
        734.7(b).

        Here, glslang proper means core GLSL parsing, HLSL parsing, and SPIR-V code
        generation. Glslang proper requires use of two licenses, one that covers
        non-preprocessing and an additional one that covers preprocessing.

        Bison was removed long ago. You can build glslang from the source grammar,
        using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.

        Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:

        - gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
          a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.

        - update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
          not need to be used.

        - the SPIR-V "remapper", which is optional, but has the same license as
          glslang proper

        - Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
          are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991


         Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                            675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

        [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
         numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                        Preamble

          The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
        Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

          This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
        specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
        other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
        your libraries, too.

          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
        in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

          To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
        These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
        you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

          For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
        you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
        complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
        with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
        it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

          Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
        the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

          Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
        that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
        library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
        want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
        version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
        the original authors' reputations.

          Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
        patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
        software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
        transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
        we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
        free use or not licensed at all.

          Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
        GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
        license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
        designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
        one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
        the same as in the ordinary license.

          The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
        they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
        program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
        changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
        analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
        a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
        derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
        treats it as such.

          Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
        Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
        sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
        concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

          However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
        users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
        libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
        permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
        preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
        libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
        this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
        changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
        will lead to faster development of free libraries.

          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
        "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
        former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
        works together with the library.

          Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
        General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

          0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
        contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
        party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
        General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
        addressed as "you".

          A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

          The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
        which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
        Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
        straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
        included without limitation in the term "modification".)

          "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
        and installation of the library.

          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
        writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
        and what the program that uses the Library does.

          1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
        you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
        all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
        Library.

          You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
        fee.

          2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

            a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

            b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

            c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

            d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
            table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
            the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
            is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
            in the event an application does not supply such function or
            table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
            its purpose remains meaningful.

            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
            application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
            root function must still compute square roots.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
        sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
        on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
        collective works based on the Library.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
        with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
        the scope of this License.

          3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
        this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
        that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
        instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
        ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
        that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
        these notices.

          Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

          This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.

          4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
        must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange.

          If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
        distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

          5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
        linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
        therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

          However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
        library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
        Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

          When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

          If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
        functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
        file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
        work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
        Library will still fall under Section 6.)

          Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

          6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
        link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
        work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications.

          You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
        this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
        directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
        of these things:

            a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
            changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
            Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
            with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
            uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
            user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
            executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
            that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
            Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
            to use the modified definitions.)

            b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
            least three years, to give the same user the materials
            specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
            than the cost of performing this distribution.

            c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
            from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
            specified materials from the same place.

            d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
            materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

          For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
        the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
        the executable.

          It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
        distribute.

          7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
        facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
        library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
        the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
        permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
            Sections above.

            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
            that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
            where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

          8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
        the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
        attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
        rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
        or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

          9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Library or works based on it.

          10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
        subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
        this License.

          11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is
        implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.

          12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
        an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
        so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
        excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
        written in the body of this License.

          13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
        "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
        the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
        the Free Software Foundation.

          14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
        write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
        of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.

                        NO WARRANTY

          15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
        THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

          16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

          If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
        everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
        ordinary General Public License).

          To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
        safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
        "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

            <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

            This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
            modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
            License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
            version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

            This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
            Library General Public License for more details.

            You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
            License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
            Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
        school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
        necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

          Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
          library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

          <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
          Ty Coon, President of Vice

        That's all there is to it!

        Why pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License
        -------------------------------------------------------------

            The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to
            provide a quality and complete implementation of the POSIX
            threads API for Microsoft Windows within the limits imposed
            by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and not
            linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For
            example, some functions and features, such as those based
            on POSIX signals, are missing.

            Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different
            versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used
            as a dynamically linked module or a statically linked set of
            binary modules. It is not an application on it's own.

            It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be usable with
            commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL
            licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's
            code base, many of whom have done so because they have
            used the library in commercial or proprietry software
            projects.

            Releasing pthreads-win32 under the LGPL ensures that the
            library can be used widely, while at the same time ensures
            that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code
            itself is returned to benefit all current and future users
            of the library.

            Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications
            that use POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the
            broader goal of the project is to encourage the use of open
            standards, and in particular, to make it just a little easier
            for developers writing Win32 applications to consider
            widening the potential market for their products.

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
