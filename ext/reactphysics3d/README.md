## :book: Documentation

You can find the user manual and the Doxygen API documentation <a href="https://www.reactphysics3d.com/documentation.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## :information_source: Branches

The "master" branch always contains the last released version of the library and some possible hot fixes. This is the most stable version. On the other side,
the "develop" branch is used for development. This branch is frequently updated and can be quite unstable. Therefore, if you want to use the library in
your application, it is recommended to checkout the "master" branch.
