# 1. What is Editor?
- Editor is our TDME2 project content editor, featuring tabs for the following type of content
    - Empties
    - Triggers
    - Environment Maps        
    - 3D Models
    - Particle Systems
    - Terrains
    - Scenes
    - TDME2 UIs
    - Texts
    - Sounds
    - Textures
    - Fonts
- It has a hierarchal project folder view
- It has a folder content view with preview for each file if available      
- It has a hierarchal outliner for each tab managed by the tabs itself
- It has context menus for outliner and folder content view
- It also provides search functions at certain places in the editor

  - operations are place, delete
  - load a predefined or user generated texture as brush, whereas the rgb color space is used as density base
  - set up the texture scale
  - set up the density which will be multiplied with density base derived from texture rgb color space
  - each prototype that will be painted has the following properties
    - scale min, max
