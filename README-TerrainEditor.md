- What is TDMETerrainEditor?
    - TDME2 based 3D terrain editor 

- What is already working
    - setting up terrain properties
        - key, value map for what ever reason
    - create terrain from 1m x 1m up to 4000m x 4000m
    - load and save terrains
    - use a brush to alter terrain with predefined or user generated textures
      - operations are add, subtract, flatten, delete, smooth
      - load a predefined or user generated texture as brush, whereas the rgb color space is used as strength base
      - set up the texture scale
      - set up the strength which will be multiplied with strength base derived from texture rgb color space
      - foliage gets updated after terrain height change
      - the terrain brush is displayed on top of terrain
    - create water meshes with a auto fill like algorithm at grabbed brush terrain height
    - use a brush to add or remove foliage with predefined or user generated textures
      - operations are place, delete
      - load a predefined or user generated texture as brush, whereas the rgb color space is used as density base
      - set up the texture scale
      - set up the density which will be multiplied with density base derived from texture rgb color space
      - each prototype that will be painted has the following properties
        - scale min, max
        - rotation range X axis min, max
        - rotation range Y axis min, max
        - rotation range Z axis min, max
        - slope min, max
        - height min, max
        - normal align
      - the foliage brush is displayed on top of terrain
    - use the ramp tool to connect higher terrain with lower terrain
