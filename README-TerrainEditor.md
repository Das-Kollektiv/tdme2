- What is TDMETerrainEditor?
    - TDME2 based 3D terrain editor 

- What is already working
    - setting up terrain properties
        - key, value map for what ever reason
    - create terrain from 1m x 1m up to 4000m x 4000m
    - load and save terrains
    - use a brush to alter terrain with predefined or user generated textures
      - operations are add, subtract, flatten, delete, smooth
      - load a predefined or user generated texture as brush, whereas the rgb color space is used as strength base
      - set up the texture scale
      - set up the strength which will be multiplied with strength base derived from texture rgb color space
      - TODO: water brush that works similar to flatten
    - create water meshes with a auto fill like algorithm at grabbed brush terrain height
      - this is WIP
    - use foliage brushes
      - this is WIP
