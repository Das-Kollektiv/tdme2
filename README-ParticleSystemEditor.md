- What is TDMEParticleSystemEditor?
    - TDME based particle system editor 

- What is already working
    - particle system loading
    - particle system saving
    - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
    - rotate, zoom
    - setting up particle system properties
        - key, value map for what ever reason
    - setting up a particle system group which consists of multiple particle systems, for each you can
      - set up the type
          - object particle system
          - point particle system
          - fog particle system
      - set up and edit the emitter
          - point particle emitter
          - bounding box particle emitter
          - circle particle emitter
          - circle particle emitter with velocity on circle plane
          - sphere particle emitter
      -  emitters can be transformed by using a gizmo
    - setting up bounding volumes
        - none
        - sphere
        - capsule
        - bounding box
        - oriented bounding box
        - convex mesh
        - bounding volumes can be transformed by using a gizmo 
    - sound
        - attach sounds to optional animations with optional additional key
        - also set up gain, pitch, looping, fixed and offset for each sound
