- What is TDMEParticleSystemEditor?
    - TDME based particle system editor 

- What is already working
    - particle system loading
    - particle system saving
    - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
    - rotate, zoom
    - setting up particle system properties
        - key, value map for what ever reason
    - setting up type
        - object particle system
        - point particle system
    - setting up emitter
        - point particle emitter
        - bounding box particle emitter
        - circle particle emitter
        - circle particle emitter with velocity on circle plane
        - sphere particle emitter
    - setting up up to 8 bounding volumes
        - none
        - sphere
        - capsule
        - bounding box
        - oriented bounding box
