- What is TDMEModelEditor?
    - TDME based 3D model asset viewer/editor 

- What is already working
    - model loading
        - DAE, Wavefront OBJ, FBX, TM model files and TMM meta data files
    - model meta data file saving 
        - TMM
            - stores its model as TM file additionally
    - render with generated ground, shadowing, bounding volume
    - rotate, zoom
    - setting up the model pivot
    - set up rendering options
        - shader
        - contribute/receiving dynamic shadowing
        - set up as render group
    - setting up bounding volumes
        - none
        - sphere
        - capsule
        - bounding box
        - oriented bounding box
        - convex mesh
          - multiple convex meshes can be automatically generated from any mesh using V-HACD
          - or be imported from a given model with each top level node representing a convex mesh
        - concave terrain mesh
        - bounding volumes can be transformed by using a gizmo 
    - setting up physics properties
      - body type, mass, bounciness, friction, inertia tensor
    - setting up model properties
        - key, value map for what ever reason
    - LOD level editor
        - type, distance, model, adjustment add/mul color, ... 
    - material editor
        - adjust colors, textures, masked transparency
    - animations editor
        - create, edit and delete animations
        - relate sounds to animations
    - preview to test your model
      - set up base animation and up to 3 animation overlays
      - attach models on bones
    - sound
        - attach sounds to optional animations with optional additional key
        - also set up gain, pitch, looping, fixed and offset for each sound
    - tools
        - be able to compute smooth normals
        - be able to optimize models in terms of mesh nodes and materials
    - see statistics
        - opaque faces
        - transparent faces
        - material count
