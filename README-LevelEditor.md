                - key, value map for what ever reason
        - models
            - see model editor
        - particle systems
            - see particle system editor
        - empties
        - trigger
    - level editor
        - setting up a grid where to place objects on
        - load, save maps, showing level dimension
        - import maps from model files like FBX, DAE or TM
        - setting up map properties
            - key, value map for what ever reason
        - objects
             - set up name, description
             - see model name, center
        - setting up object transformations for a single or multiple objects
             - translation
             - scaling
             - rotation
             - color your objects
             - center objects
             - remove objects
        - setting up object properties
             - key, value map for what ever reason
        - set up up to 8 lights (for now)
        - see and select entities(models, particle systems, empties and trigger) from entity library to place them on map
        - rotate, zoom and pan map, selecting objects
        - copy and paste
    - other
        - large objects like terrain meshes can be partitioned in 64mx64mx64m objects

- What is WIP
    - set up arbitrary lights as entities
    - audio support
